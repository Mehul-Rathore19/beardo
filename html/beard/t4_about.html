Ever wondered why all great men sport beards? We pondered upon this thought and found that men with a greater cause and intellect accept their individuality, are rational and are always open to out-of-the-box ideas (some even come up with them). They take pride in being real and different, just what it takes to be a Beardo. Anybody can grow a beard but not everybody can be a Beardo.<br>
The 21st century has given a new meaning to being a man...men may look tough by the exteriors but they're sensitive and empathetic towards everyone and they are not shy to show their softer side. While the fashion and grooming habits of men have changed over the years, a broody bearded look is a classic and still loved the most. With various bearded looks back in rage, Beardo observed the lack of grooming products for men and therefore decided to change the grooming game for men with exclusive products made using choicest ingredients and a quality controlled manufacturing process. Beardo is not just a beard care expert that only focusses on beard grooming products, we’ve also forayed into men’s skincare range that includes scrub, moisturiser, masks, bodywash, serums et al and a carefully curated hair care range that focuses on hair types and various hair problems that men are prone to. We always come up with breakthrough products which are hassle-free to use and are effective on men. Our primary focus is to change mens’ grooming game and help them become stylish and sexier than ever. Being a true-blue Beardo at heart, we’ll always bring forth products that men don't merely need but truly deserve.</p>
